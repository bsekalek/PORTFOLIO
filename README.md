## SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Bruno Sękalski
### 🔎 About me

👋 Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm an enthusiastic and detail-oriented software tester committed to ensuring the quality and functionality of applications. With a solid understanding of manual testing methodologies, I take a meticulous approach to identify and document defects. My passion lies in contributing to collaborative testing efforts and continually improving testing practices.

My journey into software testing stems from a desire for constant self-development and using my talent to uncover errors. Being a software tester allows me to serve as the guardian of software quality, seizing endless opportunities to find typos, logical errors, and ways to enhance functionality. I thrive on using creativity to explore new ways to challenge software and employ empathy to view it from the user's perspective. Caring about my colleagues, I craft test cases with clarity for easy step reproduction.

In terms of skills, I've honed my expertise in Java, SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Postman, GIT, and gained a foundation in HTML/CSS during my training. My primary goal is the continuous improvement of testing practices while executing innovative projects. Let's connect and explore the exciting world of software testing together! 🚀
